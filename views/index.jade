        h1(id="guidelines") User Interface Guidelines
        p The User Interface Style Guide is here to help maintain your brand across multiple platforms (desktop, tablet, mobile, ios, android, etc) and across multiple markets. Constant iteration requires both an efficient workflow and a well defined collection of core UI elements that can be assembled quickly. Reinventing the wheel is out and standards are in.
        p This documentation references our core UI patterns. It is our hope this guide will decrease uncertainty in the workplace and increase efficiency. This uniform lexicon of code and UI elements benefits us in a many ways:
        ul
          li We can build consistently and focus on workflows and logic, not web forms and list items
          li We can reuse code instead of roping in a developer
          li We can maintain our code by seeing our patterns in one place, define elements in our application, and keep redundancy to a minimum
          li We add new patterns only when the case for doing so is sound. New patterns come at a high costâ€”they require new design elements, additional code, maintenance, and they increase the cognitive load on users.
